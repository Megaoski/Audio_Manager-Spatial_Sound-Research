<h1>AUDIO MANAGER & SPATIAL AUDIO RESEARCH</h1>

Hi, i'm Oscar Larios, student of the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer Ricard Pillosu.


<h2>A little bit of history<h2>

Sound has become a very important theme in the world of the videogames nowadays, it's inexplicable for us to play to a game and to not  have some type of music or fx's. But this hasn't always been the case.
If we look a few years ago, more exactly in the 70's, when Pong was released as an arcade videogame, it already had some fx's to show   when the players collided with the ball or when the ball collided with the walls, but it was just a change of the pitch in the "beep"   sound. This small fx already creates the sensation of different actions(padding the ball, collisding with the wall or scoring)
  
Later in the 80's with the NES in the market, the sound in videogames improved, but the size memeory that 1 NES game had as an         
average(384kb) didn't left music composers too much space for work, so most of the sound in that time were simple(4 tracks per game)   
and it was simple and basic computer sounding waveforms.
Nowadays it's totally different, we can create a videogame with lots of cool fx's and music without catching our fingers with some 
memory issues

<h2>Audio Manager & Spatial Audio, what are they?<h2>
<h3>Audio Manager</h3>
An Audio Manager is a tool/part of the code of our videogame, that let's us create, manipulate or erase Music and Fx's in a game.
In our case, we will be using j1Audio.h and j1Audio.cpp files to do so.
<h3>Spatial Sound</h3>
Spatial Sound is a sound effect that allows us the player/listener to recognize the space, direction of the sound and distance          between   us and that sound while listening to it. Some people call it the 3d sound effect
